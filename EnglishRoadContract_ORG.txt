In the technical file¹⁹ it was established that the stroke of the road develops taking full advantage of the current road, modifying in some sectors in order to meet the characteristics of the road according to the DG - 2001 road manual. Regarding the geometric design of the technical file, the average daily index (IMD) was considered <400 vehicles, classifying the tau - pallasca section as a third -class road; Also, according to the orographic conditions the section crosses sectors of marked orography, which vary between type 3 and type 4; Given these conditions, and according to the classification of the Peruvian road network and its relationship with the speed of design 20, it was established as design speed 30 km/h; Finally, considering these conditions and taking as reference the low volume road design manualIn transit, the technical file considered a road width of 5.50 m, and a berm width of 0.50 m.

With these considerations, the geometric design was developed along the length of the Tauca-Pallasca section, adapting the existing road to the project line (the same that complied with the DG-2001); However, in the sections corresponding to the archaeological segments, the designer did not continue with the project line maintaining the existing platform width, executing the respective splices in each of the archaeological segments, as shown as an example in the following image corresponding to section Km 0+740 to km 1+020 of the project, and the discontinuous green line is the width of the existing road:

22304.10 Slopes. The slope is the design inclination given to the lateral field of the road, both in cutting areas and in embankments. This inclination is the tangent of the angle formed by the plane of the surface of the terrain and the horizontal theoretical line. The slopes for the cut sections will vary according to the geomechanical characteristics of the land; Its height, inclination and other design or treatment details will be determined according to the study of corresponding soil or geological mechanics, surface and underground drainage conditions, as the case may be, in order to determine the conditions of its stability, an aspect that must be contemplated in a priority during the design of the project, especially in areas that present unstable geological failures or materials, to opt for the most convenient solution, among various alternatives.

It should be noted that during the physical inspection visit to the work carried out from September 16 to 18, 2024, the evaluation team warned that the intervention areas have vegetation coverage, this condition could be affected when the cutting works were executed (2: 1, V: H),since this vegetation coverage would be removed leaving the ground exposed to erosion due to the leaks of the irrigation of the cultivation areas located in the upper part and the rainfall of the area, being that the plant roots transmit stability to the slope and contribute in the drying of the absorption of the groundwater; In addition, the existence of high -voltage accesses and towers at the top, interference that have not been identified in the technical documentation sent by the entity was noted.

From the revision to the geometric design of the contractual technical file, it was described to the Tauca - Pallasca section, as a third -class road, with an average daily index (IMD) less than 400 vehicles, with orographic conditions that vary between type 3 and type 4; and a design speed 30 km/h. With these conditions and taking as a reference the low -volume road design manual, the designer considered a 5.50 m road width, and a 0.50m berm width.

--- Processsed Block 709 (Text) ---
The geometric design was developed along the length of the Tauca-Pallasca section, adapting the existing road to the project line (the same one that complied with the DG-2001); However, in the sections corresponding to the archaeological segments, the designer did not continue with the project line, executing the respective splices with the sections of the aforementioned segments that maintain the existing platform width.

--- Processsed Block 710 (Text) ---
With the incorporation of archaological segments into the archaeological monitoring plan, the restriction of intervening in the aforementioned segments was eliminated, which is why, in the technical file of PAO No. 32, the entity develops the geometric design to comply with the road width istabded in the project

On the other hand, during the physical inspection of the work, carried out between September 16 and 18, 2024, the evaluation team corroborated the need to make slope cut, in sectors whose current platform width is less than that raised in the technical file; However, it was also verified that in certain progressive the current width of the road is greater than that established in the geometric design of the project, which are detailed in the following table:
